# newWave

newWave is a marketplace for musicians to sell, buy, or trade music instruments.

## Installation

1. Clone this repository
2. Run 'npm install' in the project directory
3. Clone the backend repo to your machine and follow those instructions
4. Ensure that you have succesfully started the Rails server
5. Run 'npm start'

## Usage

From the landing page, look through the instrument categories carousel and click on a category to see a list of instruments

Sort instruments by price and/or filter by whether the instrument is available for sale, barter, or both

View all instruments of a given category and click on 'see more details' to go to an instruments show page

The show page gives you more information on the instrument and allows you to delete or edit the listing or click the envelope to present an email modal to contact the seller (the email modal is purely aesthetic at this point)

The navbar allows you to direct back to the home page, go to your profile page to view your info and purchase history or direct to a form to make a new listing
